					Arc &amp; Ash is in constant flux, 
					flowing from a pedal-to-the-metal design 
					&amp; production company to a slow, 
					thoughtful &amp; deliberate design &amp; 
					research endeavor. Past projects have combined
					character-rich pieces of wood with the easy curves
					of hand-shaped steel to create simple &amp; functional
					terrarium stands and plant habitats.
