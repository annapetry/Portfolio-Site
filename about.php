			<p>I&#146m a designer, a maker, and a do-it-myselfer.  
				I love diving into mixed-media projects, be it wood working, metal mashing, or pixel pushing.  
				<br>
				<br>
				My approach to design is thoughtful and thorough, communicative and creative.
				<br>
				<br>
				I&#146m at my best when knee deep in a project, so if you&#146ve got one in mind, drop me a line.  
				I&#146d love to hear from you.
