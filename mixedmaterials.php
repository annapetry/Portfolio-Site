					I cherish the luxury of spending hours in the shop.  Carving, 
					welding, sewing, or drawing, I conceive my best ideas while 
					working on projects of all sorts.  My personal work tends to
					focus on well-designed and functional pieces, like tables, 
					bed frames, trellises, and planters, but I also like to 
					balance that bias with more form-based work.
