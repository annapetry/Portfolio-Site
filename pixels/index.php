				In addition to personal digital design work, I've helped
				clients create logos and brands for their small businesses.
				I love learning about the goals of the client,
				who they aim to serve, and how they want their customers to feel. 
				Understanding the needs of a client is crutial to deliverying 
				designs that resonate and connect with their audience.
